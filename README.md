an analysis of the card game Figgie (https://www.figgie.com)

## Introduction
Figgie is a card game developed by Jane Street in 2013 to emulate the dynamics of open-outcry commodities trading. The game accommodates 4 or 5 players, each starting with $350 in chips. Players trade cards representing four suits—spades (♠), clubs (♣), hearts (♥), and diamonds (♦)—with the objective of amassing the most wealth over multiple rounds. citeturn0search0

**Deck Composition:**

- **Total Cards:** 40

- **Suits Distribution:**
  - One suit with 12 cards
  - One suit with 8 cards
  - Two suits with 10 cards each

The specific distribution of suits is unknown to players at the start of each round.

**Objective:**

The primary goal is to identify and collect cards from the "goal suit," which is the suit that matches the color (red or black) of the 12-card suit. The goal suit contains either 8 or 10 cards and is the only suit with value at the end of the round. citeturn0search0
